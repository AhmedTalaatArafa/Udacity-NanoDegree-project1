Facial Keypoint Detection using Deep learning 

## Project Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build
a facial keypoint detection system.
Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. 
These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. 


The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks,
__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

__Notebook 4__ : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
